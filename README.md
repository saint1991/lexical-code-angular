Sample usage of CodePlugin and its [node overrides](https://lexical.dev/docs/concepts/node-replacement) of [Lexical](https://github.com/facebook/lexical).


## Note

In Angular app, to utilize components scss, DOMs must be rendered by [Renderer2](https://angular.io/api/core/Renderer2) instance injected in the component. For the workaround against that styles are defined in global styles.scss so far.
